# Poverty-Probability-Prediction
This project is analysis on data concerning the Poverty Probability Index (PPI) of individuals. By exploring the relationships between characteristics of the individuals and their PPI, we extract useful information that would allow us to make prediction of an individual’s probability of poverty based on its socioeconomic indicators. The dataset retrieved from the PPI website1 and Financial Inclusion Insights household surveys conducted by InterMedia contains PPI data along with 58 features of 12,600 individuals across 7 different countries. Original sources of the dataset include data from The World Bank. The PPI is a measure to identify an individual’s probability of living below the poverty line at the $2.50/day threshold, calculated with answers from 10 questions on a household’s characteristics and asset ownership statuses.
The first part of the report is an exploratory data analysis, where we calculate summary statistics and create data visualizations of the data that identify potential relationships between individuals’ characteristics and their PPI. In the second part, we create a predictive machine learning model that predicts the PPI of individuals, based on the information extracted in the first part.
